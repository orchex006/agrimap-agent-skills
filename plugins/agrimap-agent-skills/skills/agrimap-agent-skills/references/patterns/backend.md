# Backend patterns

Apply [backend-engineer.md](../backend-engineer.md) Required classification, Profile detection, Host profiles, and Structure over logic unchanged. This file owns only pattern-specific flow and placement.

For C# targets, apply the compact [C# coding baseline](csharp.md) before using raw legacy examples. Its owner-approved templates remain authoritative for new work even when the target repository has no local example code.

## Main flow

Use the local Clean Architecture implementation. The baseline request flow is:

```text
Presentation/Controller -> Application/UseCase -> Domain -> Repository port -> Infrastructure implementation -> response mapping
```

Create only responsibilities required by the feature. Do not generate the entire chain for a library, SQL-only task, simple endpoint reuse, or feature that has no new persistence dependency.

## Responsibility placement

| Artifact | Place by meaning |
| --- | --- |
| HTTP request/response contract | Presentation DTO |
| Business identity, invariant, value, or concept reused beyond persistence | Domain entity/model/value object |
| MongoDB document or ORM entity | `Infrastructure.Persistence.Models` |
| AtlasX Core Query result with business meaning | Domain entity/value object |
| AtlasX Core Query result that is the outward HTTP contract | Presentation response DTO |
| Data-access abstraction | `Infrastructure.Persistence.Interfaces` |
| SQL/API implementation and mapping | Infrastructure |

Do not create `Infrastructure.Persistence.Models` merely because a repository returns AtlasX data. Classify the result by meaning and use a Domain type or the final response DTO. Do not add another namespace or `Application.Models` to hold it.

Do not relocate existing repository interfaces or models across layers during a feature/bug task unless the selected scope explicitly includes architecture correction.

## Controller and use case

- Keep controllers thin and contract-focused.
- Keep orchestration, business validation, and flow decisions in the use case.
- Keep data access and external service mechanics in Infrastructure.
- Register new dependencies using the current DI pattern.
- Preserve route, DTO, response, error, and stored-procedure contracts unless change is approved.

## Error-code contract

BE can originate a code in Domain/Application, translate it at the response boundary, or forward it from Infrastructure/SQL. For every affected vertical slice, apply [Error/message reconciliation](../backend-engineer.md#error-message-reconciliation) and the SQL [Message collection gate](sql.md#message-collection-gate) when a procedure participates. Do not create a second entry for a code whose meaning is already identical, and do not remap a conflicting meaning silently. An AgriMap-deployed message is written to the canonical domain `messages.sql` with duplicate/idempotency evidence; otherwise report `no message changes` or the proven separately owned external-registry boundary.

## HTTP request values

When a BE slice reads cookies, headers, query/form fields, or JSON bodies, apply [HTTP request-value normalization](../backend-engineer.md#http-request-value-normalization). The `AgriMap.Platform.Extensions` pattern serves both `be-main` consumers and the `be-library` owner: first non-blank Cookie -> Header -> QueryString, normalize blank to `null`, trim values, defer body reads, centralize key names, and add no DI registration for static extensions. Before refactor, inventory direct access and prove semantic equivalence rather than replacing syntax globally.

## `backend_profile=agmbo`

Use the `backend_profile=agmbo` flow and shared knowledge defined in [backend-engineer.md](../backend-engineer.md#backend_profileagmbo). Inspect `Infrastructure/Jobs/JobScheduler.cs`; add no schedule when the feature is only an executable batch operation.

## BE libraries

For every library feature:

- update public API and compatibility notes;
- update `README.md` with setup and usage;
- add or update the Playground example;
- run library tests/build and the Playground verification path.

Current curated BE-library references live under `golden/backend-libraries/` and cover public behavior, configuration, README-style usage, and Playground paths. Match them to the active package version and published surface. No verified `backend_profile=agmbo` scheduler example exists yet — that gap covers **only `Infrastructure/Jobs/JobScheduler.cs`**, not the rest of an `agmbo` slice. Synthesize the scheduler entry from standard Quartz.NET practice under the thin-trigger rule (scheduling/registration only, business logic in the use case), note the missing example in the receipt as an intake follow-up, and continue; do not block the task on it.

## Golden examples

Enter the collection through the checklist for the detected target kind —
[checklists/backend-main.md](checklists/backend-main.md) or
[checklists/backend-libraries.md](checklists/backend-libraries.md) — which carries the `MUST` rows,
the entry owning each, and the namespace allowlist.

Raw legacy-compatible blocks live under `golden/backend-main/`; current curated library references live under `golden/backend-libraries/`. Their manifests record status, evidence mode, hashes, and source provenance.

Read [conflict-resolution.md](conflict-resolution.md) before using them. Known legacy issues include duplicate imports, duplicate placeholder methods, inconsistent async naming, pseudo-JSON files, and ambiguous Domain versus persistence placement.

For new code, classify models by meaning and keep namespaces within the fixed C# allowlist. Preserve existing public contracts and layer placement during a feature/bug task unless architecture correction is explicitly in scope. Treat raw blocks as compatibility evidence, never a universal or copy-ready mandate.
