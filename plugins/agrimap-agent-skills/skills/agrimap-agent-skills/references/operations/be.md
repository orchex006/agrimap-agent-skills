# Compact operation entrypoint: agm-be

<!-- Generated from config/operations.json. Do not edit directly. -->

- Operation: `be`
- Workflow depth: default `light`; allowed `light`, `standard`, `regulated`
- Mode: `action-routed`
- Purpose: Analyze, design, create, edit, refactor, or explicitly test backend work through one domain façade.
- Deliverable: requested result with proportional evidence; no lifecycle for ordinary answers

## Action gate

Resolve exactly one action before target inspection or product writes. Safe defaults are read-only; fallback is action routing, not a passive capability. Capabilities support the chosen read or authorized write but cannot choose it or create write intent.

| Action | Mode | Activation | Allowed depth | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `analyze` | `product-read-only` | `explicit-or-safe-default` | `light`, `standard`, `regulated` | Inspect backend scope, contracts, callers, data, risks, and trade-offs without editing |
| `design` | `product-read-only` | `explicit-or-safe-default` | `light`, `standard`, `regulated` | Define backend boundaries, flow, validation, failure behavior, and acceptance without editing |
| `create` | `product-write` | `explicit` | `light`, `standard`, `regulated` | Create a bounded new backend slice |
| `edit` | `product-write` | `explicit` | `light`, `standard`, `regulated` | Modify a bounded existing backend slice |
| `refactor` | `product-write` | `explicit` | `light`, `standard`, `regulated` | Refactor backend code under exactly one behavior mode and a proven preservation boundary |
| `test` | `product-write` | `explicit` | `light`, `standard`, `regulated` | Create explicitly requested or selected backend tests after embedded test-decision advice |

## Inputs and help

- Required: one action or unambiguous natural-language intent; an objective or pointed backend target.
- Conditional: target_kind, backend_profile, and phase when repository evidence cannot resolve them; requester selection when embedded test-decision advice finds unspecified coverage.
- Minimal example: `$agm-be action=create target_kind=be-main backend_profile=agmws objective="Add cancel-order endpoint"`

## Execute this contract

1. Resolve exactly one action before inspection. Explicit action= wins; otherwise infer only from unambiguous verbs and report the resolved action. Ask one short question when create, edit, refactor, or read versus write remains ambiguous.
2. For analyze/design, never edit product files. For authorized create/edit/test, choose depth from tracking and boundary needs; no extra prompt ceremony.
3. For action=refactor, require exactly one mode before editing, preserve the declared logic boundary, and ask only about unresolved material behavior choices.
4. Apply the embedded test-decision capability during analyze, design, create, edit, and refactor. Classify required, recommended, or not_applicable; write tests only for action=test, a clear test request, or required coverage inside authorized implementation.

Do not read the router `SKILL.md` during operation execution. If this generated entrypoint is missing or corrupt, stop with `PACKAGE_ENTRYPOINT_MISSING` and ask for package sync/reinstallation; never broaden into the router.
