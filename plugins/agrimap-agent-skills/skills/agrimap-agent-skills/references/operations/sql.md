# Compact operation entrypoint: agm-sql

<!-- Generated from config/operations.json. Do not edit directly. -->

- Operation: `sql`
- Workflow depth: default `light`; allowed `light`, `standard`, `regulated`
- Mode: `action-routed`
- Purpose: Analyze, design, create, edit, refactor, or explain SQL work through one domain façade.
- Deliverable: requested result with proportional evidence; no lifecycle for ordinary answers

## Action gate

Resolve exactly one action before target inspection or product writes. Safe defaults are read-only; fallback is action routing, not a passive capability. Capabilities support the chosen read or authorized write but cannot choose it or create write intent.

| Action | Mode | Activation | Allowed depth | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `analyze` | `product-read-only` | `explicit-or-safe-default` | `light`, `standard`, `regulated` | Inspect SQL scope, schema, callers, contracts, risks, and trade-offs without editing |
| `design` | `product-read-only` | `explicit-or-safe-default` | `light`, `standard`, `regulated` | Define SQL objects, data flow, result and error contracts, deployment, and acceptance without editing |
| `create` | `product-write` | `explicit` | `light`, `standard`, `regulated` | Create a bounded new SQL object or slice |
| `edit` | `product-write` | `explicit` | `light`, `standard`, `regulated` | Modify a bounded existing SQL object or slice |
| `refactor` | `product-write` | `explicit` | `light`, `standard`, `regulated` | Refactor SQL under exactly one behavior mode while preserving declared results, transactions, side effects, errors, and deployment behavior |
| `explain` | `product-read-only` | `explicit-or-safe-default` | `light`, `standard`, `regulated` | Explain SQL purpose, contracts, reads/writes, flow, transactions, errors, assumptions, and risks without execution or edits |

## Inputs and help

- Required: one action or unambiguous natural-language intent; an objective or pointed SQL target.
- Conditional: target_kind when table/procedure placement cannot be resolved; output_owner=product|owner-reference|knowledge-draft for new SQL; an exact existing SQL target for edit/refactor; owner evidence for persisted-data, reference promotion, or contract decisions.
- Minimal example: `$agm-sql action=explain target_files=sql/ORDER/ORDER_Q.sql`

## Execute this contract

1. Resolve exactly one action before inspection. Explicit action= wins; otherwise infer only from unambiguous verbs and report the resolved action. Ask one short question when create, edit, refactor, or read versus write remains ambiguous.
2. For analyze/design/explain, use local evidence or managed read-only SQL context; never execute DDL/DML/EXEC or edit product files. Explain uses FACT, INFERENCE, and UNKNOWN and routes requested modifications to edit.
3. Edit/refactor requires an exact existing target; otherwise stop SQL_EDIT_TARGET_NOT_FOUND. Never switch to create; preserve the existing path unless migration is authorized.
4. Create requires output_owner=product|owner-reference|knowledge-draft; otherwise stop SQL_OUTPUT_OWNER_REQUIRED. The absence of a directory is never create authority.
5. Skill-package meta work never authorizes root product SQL; fixtures/examples require an explicit package-owned path.
6. Every created or edited stored procedure must declare CREATE OR ALTER PROCEDURE; replace standalone CREATE PROCEDURE, ALTER PROCEDURE, CREATE PROC, or ALTER PROC and validate the complete changed SQL path set.
7. For authorized create/edit, load relevant schema/callers and use proportional tracking.
8. For action=refactor, require exactly one mode before editing; when materially ambiguous, ask about the behavior boundary. Preserve result sets, transactions, side effects, error mapping, and deployment idempotency unless recorded authority and the selected mode explicitly allow a change, then format and validate every declared changed SQL path.

## Load only when the condition matches

- When action=refactor: [refactor-modes.md](../refactor-modes.md) — exact refactor behavior and logic-change boundary
- When any table, view, or procedure outside the edited file is read, joined, or written: [db-schema-context.md](../db-schema-context.md) — owner DDL evidence for every referenced object
- When material intent remains unresolved: [elicitation.md](../elicitation.md) — resolve only consequential ambiguity
- When database context is needed: [sql-context-readonly.md](../sql-context-readonly.md) — managed read-only metadata and SELECT; never database writes

Do not read the router `SKILL.md` during operation execution. If this generated entrypoint is missing or corrupt, stop with `PACKAGE_ENTRYPOINT_MISSING` and ask for package sync/reinstallation; never broaden into the router.
