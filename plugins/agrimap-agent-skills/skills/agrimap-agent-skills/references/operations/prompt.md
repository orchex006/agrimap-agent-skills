# Compact operation entrypoint: agm-prompt

<!-- Generated from config/operations.json. Do not edit directly. -->

- Operation: `prompt`
- Workflow depth: default `light`; allowed `light`
- Mode: `workflow-write-only`
- Purpose: Analyze and refine requester intent into one immutable versioned Prompt Result with explicit Main and Subagent ownership.
- Deliverable: one immutable Prompt Result only when requested content changes; no tasks

## Inputs and help

- Required: objective or prompt text; conversation/session/context identity.
- Conditional: explicit source Prompt Result path for revision; owner confirmation when implicit source selection is ambiguous; target_kind/backend_profile for target-specific work.
- Minimal example: `$agm-prompt objective="Prepare a complete cancel-order implementation prompt" context=cancel-order`

## Execute this contract

1. Classify continuation intent. Explain/compare/propose/acknowledge/approve never create a version.
2. Create V1 for the first finalized executable result; create V2+ only for substantive requester-backed changes. Reuse identical content and preserve lineage.
3. Keep one file per version with Main/Subagent ownership; never create requirements or tasks.

Do not read the router `SKILL.md` during operation execution. If this generated entrypoint is missing or corrupt, stop with `PACKAGE_ENTRYPOINT_MISSING` and ask for package sync/reinstallation; never broaden into the router.
