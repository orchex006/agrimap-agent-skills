# Compact operation entrypoint: agm-analyze

<!-- Generated from config/operations.json. Do not edit directly. -->

- Operation: `analyze`
- Workflow depth: default `light`; allowed `light`, `standard`, `regulated`
- Mode: `product-read-only`
- Purpose: Analyze scope, hidden problems, impacts, and trade-offs.
- Deliverable: requested result with proportional evidence; no lifecycle for ordinary answers

## Inputs and help

- Required: objective or a pointed target.
- Conditional: target_kind when repository evidence cannot resolve the affected discipline.
- Minimal example: `$agm-analyze target_files=src/orders.ts objective="Explain duplicate requests; do not edit"`

## Execute this contract

1. Inspect the full target and affected callers before conclusions. Database-linked conclusions require actual project code, the applicable db-schema, and representative local examples/data shapes; otherwise label the result preliminary and list the missing evidence without guessing. Managed read-only context retrieval follows sql-context-readonly.md; never create a direct connection or execute database writes.
2. Return evidence-backed findings at the requested level of detail. No mandatory headings or task artifacts for questions; never edit product artifacts.

- When database context is needed: [sql-context-readonly.md](../sql-context-readonly.md) — managed read-only metadata and SELECT; never database writes

Do not read the router `SKILL.md` during operation execution. If this generated entrypoint is missing or corrupt, stop with `PACKAGE_ENTRYPOINT_MISSING` and ask for package sync/reinstallation; never broaden into the router.
