# sql-context-pack: read-only supporting capability

Use when a task needs exact schema/metadata or bounded protected data that local authoritative references cannot answer. Local `sql/**` files and `.agrimap-agent/knowledge/references/db-schema/**` come first ([db-schema-context.md](db-schema-context.md)). Do not create a new AgriMap task for retrieval.

## Who owns the turn

- Supporting: Inside any agm-* operation sql-context-pack (3.0.0 or later) is supporting evidence only: its read-only tools and recipes (metadata and protected SELECT). No DDL/DML, EXEC/CALL, export, metadata sync, classification, routine deployment or reveal of protected values.
- Owner turn: A direct owner request to sql-context-pack (its invocation, or naming it with an owner operation) is that package's turn: follow its own SKILL and approval gates. AgriMap adds no authority, lifecycle or prohibition to that turn and never runs those operations inside an agm-* operation. Owner operations: export/catalog capture, DB_METADATA_CONTEXT sync, folder classification, context generation, routine deployment, profile connect/change, SQLFluff install/update.
- Owner invocations: `$sql-context-pack`, `/sql-context-pack:sql-context-pack`, `/sql-context-pack`, `$sql-content-pack`; naming the package with an owner operation counts too.

| Need | Read-only recipe |
| --- | --- |
| readiness and the connected profile | `sqlctx_get_capabilities`, then `sqlctx_get_active_profile`; no profile means a named gap (never connect, change or inherit a profile to answer) |
| which objects exist for a domain, context or tag | `sqlctx_list_context_index` with type/context/tag filters; read every page until `next_cursor` is null |
| columns, types and nullability of a table or view | `sqlctx_query_data` on `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS` filtered by exact `TABLE_SCHEMA`/`TABLE_NAME` |
| procedure or function parameters | `sqlctx_query_data` on `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARAMETERS` filtered by exact `SPECIFIC_NAME` |
| representative data shape | `sqlctx_query_data` with an explicit column list, a narrow WHERE on public columns only and `TOP` at most 500; columns marked `⟨FAKE|ALIAS|GENERALIZED|REDACTED|SCANNED…⟩` hold no real values, so say a quoted value is fake |
| real sensitive values (names, national IDs, phones, accounts, addresses) | never obtain them; relay the result or error `reveal_handoff` (`sql`, `user_steps`) verbatim so the user runs it outside the session; never run `sqlctx query --reveal` or rewrite a query around `QUERY_SENSITIVE_USAGE_RESTRICTED` |
| full DDL or routine body | read local `sql/**` or db-schema references first; if missing, name the gap and suggest the owner run an explicit `$sql-context-pack` capture; never materialize it from an AgriMap operation |

Read-only tools: `sqlctx_get_capabilities`, `sqlctx_get_active_profile`, `sqlctx_list_context_index`, `sqlctx_list_managed_folders`, `sqlctx_query_data`.
<!-- AGM-SQL-CONTEXT:END -->

Read only the query and context-index parts of the installed sql-context-pack SKILL while supporting an agm-* operation; its export, sync, classification, generation and deployment routes belong to an owner turn.

## Boundaries inside AgriMap operations

Use only the current conversation's explicitly connected profile and its allowed scope. Never inherit another room's profile or request credentials. Search exact object names, read index pagination to completion, preserve source/profile/object identity and freshness.
Permitted: capabilities, active profile, metadata/context index, registered-folder listing, relational SELECT via sqlctx_query_data with protected output (marked fakes, aliases, generalized or redacted values; never real sensitive values) and at most 500 rows.
Do not invoke CREATE/ALTER/DROP/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/MERGE/TRUNCATE, EXEC/CALL, SELECT INTO, procedure/function execution, routine deployment, metadata sync, owner-resolution apply or any database write. This restriction holds for all users/models/depths within AgriMap operations; a supporting skill cannot expand it.
Do not auto-run exports that materialize files, classify/apply folders, install tools or change profiles merely to answer a query. Missing profile/service/evidence is a named gap; continue independent work. No direct database connection fallback.
The managed service's read-only profile and query parser are authoritative. scripts/governance-policy.mjs supplies a conservative tool/query guard for adapters; this package does not proxy arbitrary SQL or grant database permissions.
