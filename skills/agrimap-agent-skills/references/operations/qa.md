# Compact operation entrypoint: agm-qa

<!-- Generated from config/operations.json. Do not edit directly. -->

- Operation: `qa`
- Workflow depth: default `light`; allowed `light`, `standard`, `regulated`
- Mode: `verification-only`
- Purpose: Verify an artifact under a product-read-only, execution-restricted QA contract.
- Deliverable: requested result with proportional evidence; no lifecycle for ordinary answers

## Inputs and help

- Required: artifact or target to verify.
- Conditional: task_id for regulated tracked QA; qa_mode=full only when an explicit full-QA trigger applies.
- Minimal example: `$agm-qa qa_mode=light artifact="integrated workspace"`

## Execute this contract

1. Choose sufficient verification from changed behavior and acceptance; reuse matching evidence.
2. Inspect final artifacts; use project-declared local checks after inspecting effects. No routine full-suite reruns, automatic third-run escalation or database writes.
3. Record actual coverage, failures and limitations; never infer success from artifact existence.

- When the backend artifact contains C#: [patterns/csharp.md](../patterns/csharp.md) — project-wide C# QA baseline
- When BE work reads or refactors cookie, header, query, form, JSON body, or device-ID resolution: [patterns/golden/backend-libraries/013-1-extensions-request-value-normalize.md](../patterns/golden/backend-libraries/013-1-extensions-request-value-normalize.md) — request-value QA behavior matrix for main/library code
- When verification touches a stored procedure, SQL, or persisted data: [db-schema-context.md](../db-schema-context.md) — schema facts required to verify data and error behavior
- When FE/BE URL, domain, redirect, or callback logic is under verification: [application-url-matrix.md](../application-url-matrix.md) — authoritative expected URL values
- When material intent remains unresolved: [elicitation.md](../elicitation.md) — resolve only consequential ambiguity

Do not read the router `SKILL.md` during operation execution. If this generated entrypoint is missing or corrupt, stop with `PACKAGE_ENTRYPOINT_MISSING` and ask for package sync/reinstallation; never broaden into the router.
