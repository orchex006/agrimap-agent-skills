# Compact operation entrypoint: agm-diagnose

<!-- Generated from config/operations.json. Do not edit directly. -->

- Operation: `diagnose`
- Workflow depth: default `light`; allowed `light`, `standard`, `regulated`
- Mode: `product-read-only`
- Purpose: Diagnose a problem to a proven root cause.
- Deliverable: requested result with proportional evidence; no lifecycle for ordinary answers

## Inputs and help

- Required: symptom.
- Conditional: reproduction evidence when the symptom is not observable from the repository.
- Minimal example: `$agm-diagnose symptom="Save returns 500" target_files=src/orders.ts implementation=false`

## Execute this contract

1. Reproduce or trace the symptom, separate causes from correlations, and test bounded hypotheses.
2. When the failing path reaches a stored procedure or SQL, open that procedure and the tables it touches from the local db-schema references, and name the exact failing condition instead of stopping at the caller.
3. Return the proven root cause, evidence, affected path, and proposed fix; do not apply the fix.

- When the backend target contains C#: [patterns/csharp.md](../patterns/csharp.md) — project-wide C# behavior and style baseline

- When the symptom may involve a stored procedure, SQL error, or persisted data: [db-schema-context.md](../db-schema-context.md) — SP → table tracing from error code to the failing condition
- When FE/BE URL, domain, redirect, or callback logic may contribute to the symptom: [application-url-matrix.md](../application-url-matrix.md) — authoritative environment-specific URL behavior
- When material intent remains unresolved: [elicitation.md](../elicitation.md) — resolve only consequential ambiguity
- When database context is needed: [sql-context-readonly.md](../sql-context-readonly.md) — managed read-only metadata and SELECT; never database writes

Do not read the router `SKILL.md` during operation execution. If this generated entrypoint is missing or corrupt, stop with `PACKAGE_ENTRYPOINT_MISSING` and ask for package sync/reinstallation; never broaden into the router.
