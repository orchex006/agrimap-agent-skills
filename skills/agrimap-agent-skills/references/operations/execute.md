# Compact operation entrypoint: agm-exec

<!-- Generated from config/operations.json. Do not edit directly. -->

- Operation: `execute`
- Workflow depth: default `light`; allowed `light`, `standard`, `regulated`
- Mode: `product-write`
- Purpose: Implement an authorized objective, approved Prompt Result, or resumable task with proportional verification and scoped delivery.
- Deliverable: requested result with proportional evidence; no lifecycle for ordinary answers

## Inputs and help

- Required: authorized objective or approved prompt or resumable task.
- Conditional: decision-owner choice only when a material deviation exceeds the authorized scope.
- Minimal example: `$agm-exec objective="Implement the accepted change"`

## Execute this contract

1. Use recorded requester authorization; a generated prompt is optional. Preserve binding scope, dependencies and acceptance while adapting implementation steps to evidence.
2. Select tracking/assurance from actual work; one task.md only when resume/handoff is needed.
3. Verify proportionally and close after actual acceptance. Separate QA only for its real risk or an explicit request.

## Load only when the condition matches

- When the authorized work targets C# backend work: [backend-engineer.md](../backend-engineer.md) — backend discipline carried into execution
- When the authorized work targets C# backend work: [patterns/csharp.md](../patterns/csharp.md) — project-wide C# execution baseline
- When the authorized backend work touches cookie, header, query, form, JSON body, or device-ID resolution: [patterns/golden/backend-libraries/013-1-extensions-request-value-normalize.md](../patterns/golden/backend-libraries/013-1-extensions-request-value-normalize.md) — request-value execution contract
- When the authorized work touches a stored procedure, table, or persisted data: [db-schema-context.md](../db-schema-context.md) — schema evidence required before data changes
- When the authorized work touches FE/BE URL, domain, redirect, or callback logic: [application-url-matrix.md](../application-url-matrix.md) — authoritative environment-specific execution values
- When material intent remains unresolved: [elicitation.md](../elicitation.md) — resolve only consequential ambiguity
- When database context is needed: [sql-context-readonly.md](../sql-context-readonly.md) — managed read-only metadata and SELECT; never database writes
- When project bootstrap, versioning, branches or release are requested: [release-and-bootstrap.md](../release-and-bootstrap.md) — project-specific adoption and release knowledge

Do not read the router `SKILL.md` during operation execution. If this generated entrypoint is missing or corrupt, stop with `PACKAGE_ENTRYPOINT_MISSING` and ask for package sync/reinstallation; never broaden into the router.
