# Golden checklist — `be-library`

Collection `golden/backend-libraries/` · status `current` · evidenceMode `curated-reference`.
Tiers and the "open, do not recall" rule: [README.md](README.md).

Detection: a class library with no web host entry, a packaged public surface, the
`README.md` + Playground convention, and no Controllers.

**The active package's published API and source stay authoritative.** These references are
maintained guidance; when a reference is older than the target package, the package wins. Match the
reference to the active package version before applying it.

## MUST — reuse the platform before building

`AgriMap.Platform` already owns these capabilities. Inspect the matching entry before writing a new
one; duplicating a platform capability without evidence fails the foundation gate in
[backend-engineer.md](../../backend-engineer.md#phase-1-foundation).

| Capability | Entry |
| --- | --- |
| `AppException` and abstractions | `001-1-abstractions-app-exception.md` |
| anonymous session | `002-1-anonymous-session.md` |
| `AppData` | `003-1-app-data.md` |
| caching | `004-1-caching.md` |
| configuration | `005-1-configuration.md` |
| content proxy | `006-1-content-proxy.md` |
| fluent HTTP client | `007-1-fluent-http-client.md` |
| logging | `008-1-logging.md` |
| mail client | `009-1-mail-client.md` |
| messaging queue | `010-1-messaging-queue.md` |
| security auth | `011-1-security-auth.md`; service handoff `011-2-security-auth-flow.md` |
| crypto: AES / BCrypt / HMAC-SHA256 | `012-1` / `012-2` / `012-3-security-crypto-*.md` |
| HTTP request-value normalization | `013-1-extensions-request-value-normalize.md` |

`011-2-security-auth-flow.md` carries project integration decisions that must be confirmed in the
target service — do not apply it as-is.

## MUST — request-value contract (`013-1-...`)

When the library reads or resolves request values:

- Precedence is Cookie (highest) → Header → QueryString (lowest); form/body only after the
  synchronous sources. First non-blank wins.
- Blank normalizes to `null`, values are trimmed, multi-value first-versus-joined behaviour is preserved.
- Key names are centralized in `ClientRequestResolverExtensions`. These are static extensions —
  **no DI registration**, and no wrapper service added merely to satisfy structure.
- Canonical device ID: Cookie `AgmTraceId` → Header `agm-device-id` → QueryString `device_id`.
  Login context cookie is `AgmLoginContextId`. This order outranks narrower historical examples.
- Refactor one caller family at a time after proving semantic equivalence. Never mass-replace syntax.

## MUST — the public surface is the contract

- Preserve the published API. An intentional change is additive first, then deprecation, then
  removal in a later major — and it updates compatibility notes in the same task.
- C# structure follows [patterns/csharp.md](../csharp.md): one public type per file, file-scoped
  namespace, `I` interface prefix, `_camelCase` private readonly dependencies, `Async` suffix on new
  async I/O, and no alias to bypass a fixed namespace.

## MUST — every library feature ships complete

One feature task updates all four ([patterns/backend.md](../backend.md#be-libraries)):

1. public API and compatibility notes;
2. `README.md` setup and usage;
3. the Playground example;
4. library tests/build **and** the Playground verification path.

A library feature that skips the Playground or README is incomplete, not "done with follow-up".

## SHOULD

Configuration shape, README section order, and logging field conventions as shown in the matching
entry, where the active package does not already prove a different published surface.

## FREE

Internal implementation of a library behaviour behind a stable public surface: algorithm,
validation body, private helpers, local decomposition.

## Before the write

1. Platform reuse checked against the capability table above.
2. Every `MUST` row verified against the opened entry, matched to the active package version.
3. `Patterns:` line lists `agm:golden/backend-libraries` plus the exact entries opened.
